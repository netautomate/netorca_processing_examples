# NetOrca Processing Examples   

This repository will contain examples on how to process requests as the Service Owner team in a NetOrca implementation. 

The examples will cover both declarative and imperative deployments to the end infrastructure and can be tailored to suit any number of implementations. 

Please take these examples as the framework to build your own deployments and swap in/out other ansible tasks as you need to suit your environment.
