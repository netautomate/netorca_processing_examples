## üöÄ What's Inside?

This repository includes automation examples for two common approaches:

- **Declarative Automation**  
  For systems like F5 BIG-IP (AS3), where you send one complete configuration describing your desired end-state.

- **Imperative Automation**  
  For devices like Palo Alto firewalls, where changes are applied individually in incremental steps.

Additionally:

- **Validation Workflow**  
  Shows how you can easily add validation or approval steps before deployment.

All examples use clear Ansible playbooks to quickly get you started.
